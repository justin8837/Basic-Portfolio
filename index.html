					"Always work on something that you enjoy" I grew up listening to thses
					words all the time from my mother. Grew up in Los Angeles with my
					mother and my sister until I was at the age of 15 and became
					independent at the age of 18. Started working part time through out my
					senior year in highschool and started working full time when I
					graduated from highschool. Always wanted to code, but never had the
					had the money nor the time to do so until now.
				</p>

					Coding was always something that I wanted to do growing up, since I
					was curious about how all these different applications and websites
					worked. My father used to work as an engineer in samsung when I was a
					little kid, so I always played around with computer parts and
					components instead of legos growing up. I wish to learn further and
					deeper into coding area so that one day I would be able to find a
					career in this field.
